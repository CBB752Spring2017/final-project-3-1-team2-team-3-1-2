DIP.png: Network from DIP. Genes with SNPs will be marked in red and all the others are green. The node size depends on its degree.
MINT.png: Network from MINT.
DIP/MINT_degree.png: Histogram for degree centrality for genes with SNPs or without SNPs. 
DIP/MINT_betweennes.png: Histogram for betweenness centrality.
The gene name mapping is based on ENSEMBL transcript ID - uniprotKB ID pairs.
The number of genes recorded in Carl's coding region SNPs file in DIP is 375 and the number in MINT is 312.
All the analyses are done by Cytoscape. Histograms are plotted in R ggplot2. The original cys files are contained. All the node attributes can be found in both cys and csv files. 
For the hierarchical analysis, please check the report.
